Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes made to files, ensuring that everyone
 can access the full history of the project and work on different parts without interfering with each other. 
Git branches allow you to work on different features or bug fixes independently from the main codebase. By creating separate branches, developers
 can experiment or make changes without affecting the main project until they are ready to merge their changes back.
